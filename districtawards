   <div class="box box__1"><span class="texts"><p>"Although we take it for granted, sanitation is a physical measure that has probably done more to increase human life span than any kind of drug or surgery.” <p>―   Deepak Chopra<p>Rotaract Club of Thapar University had organised a Sanitation drive targeting the female population in the slums. The main objective was to spread awareness regarding uses, advantages and proper methods of disposal of sanitary napkins.Rotaract Team conducted this Sanitary awareness camp in the slums near the Truck Union area and those in Bhadson road behind the University itself , where we also distributed free sanitary napkins. The warm welcomes and hopeful eyes of the less fortunate reminds us of our purpose as club and encourages us to take up such endeavours which will continue to put smiles on their faces!<span>
