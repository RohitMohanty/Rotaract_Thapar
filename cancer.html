It has helped me prioritize my life.” <p>―   Olivia Newton-John<p>The World Cancer Day (WCD) is observed every year on 4 February across the world to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage its prevention, detection, and treatment. We at Rotaract Club organised an awareness camp for students wherein they were told about various types of cancer, their prevention and were given different coloured ribbons which signified the cause. It was intended to reflect on what everyone could do to raise awareness of cancer and people were also asked to take pledge and action in fight against cancer. We urge you all to do your but and spread awareness for the sames.<span>
